# Description of task: As part of my internship at Codtech IT Solutions, my first task was to create a set of logo design mockups for the company’s mobile website. The goal was to explore diverse visual directions that align with Codtech’s brand values—innovation, technology, and modernity—while presenting them in a clean, mobile-friendly UI.

Before diving into the design, I conducted quick research on the company’s services and industry. Codtech specializes in custom software development, cloud computing, and cybersecurity, so I made sure that each logo concept reflected themes like security, progressiveness, and digital transformation. I also studied current tech logo trends to balance modern appeal with uniqueness.

I created four different logo variants, each with a distinct style, symbol, and message:

Variant 1 features a gradient logo with the initials C | T inside a rounded square. The color blend of purple and orange reflects both creativity and energy. The logo sits confidently above bold typography and a vibrant call-to-action section, giving the page a futuristic, tech-forward look.

Variant 2 explores a flower/star-inspired icon that represents excellence and continuous innovation. The orange theme here creates a professional yet friendly vibe. I added the tagline Innovation • Technology • Excellence to enhance the brand story. The “Learn More” button adopts a full orange background, creating consistency with the icon.

Variant 3 features a hexagonal icon, symbolizing security and structure. The "CT" initials are presented inside the hexagon with subtle glow and depth. This variant gives the brand a more corporate and robust personality, suitable for B2B tech clients. The layout is minimal, allowing the logo to stand out.

Variant 4 takes a bold approach with a large, rounded CT monogram supported by wave lines, symbolizing smart connectivity and modern IT solutions. This version gives off a dynamic and adaptive identity, aligned with Codtech’s focus on smart systems and flexibility.

For all versions, I designed mobile-first UI layouts to demonstrate real-world application. I used Figma for layout design and Adobe Illustrator for logo development. I paid close attention to color harmony, scalability, typography, and button styling to ensure that each variant would work across platforms and maintain brand consistency.

Throughout the process, I shared my progress regularly with mentors, took feedback constructively, and iterated on ideas to improve clarity and balance. I made sure each design was aligned with both the technical offerings and brand tone of Codtech.

This task enhanced my understanding of branding through UI design, how visual choices impact brand identity, and the importance of presenting multiple creative solutions. I learned to combine user interface thinking with visual storytelling, which is a crucial skill for any modern UI/UX Designer.
